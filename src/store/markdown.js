## by Tom Godwin

> The problem of separating the friends from the enemies was a major one in the conquest of space as many a dead spacer could have testified. A tough job when you could see an alien and judge appearances; far tougher when they were only whispers on the wind.

HE LISTENED in the silence of the Exploration ship's control room. He heard nothing but that was what bothered him; an ominous quiet when there should have been a multitude of sounds from the nearby village for the viewscreen's audio-pickups to transmit. And it was more than six hours past the time when the native, Throon, should have come to sit with him outside the ship as they resumed the laborious attempt to learn each other's language.

- The viewscreen was black in the light of the control room,
- even though it was high noon outside.
- The dull red sun was always invisible through the world's thick atmosphere
- and to human eyes full day was no more than a red-tinged darkness.

## He switched on the ship's outside floodlights

He switched on the ship's outside floodlights and the viewscreen came to bright white life, showing the empty glades reaching away between groves of purple alien trees. He noticed, absently, that the trees seemed to have changed a little in color since his arrival.


### The village was hidden from view

1. The village was hidden from view by the outer trees but there should have been some activity in the broad area visible to him.
2. There was none, not even along the distant segment of what should have been a busy road.
3. The natives were up to something and he knew, from hard experience on other alien worlds, that it would be nothing good.
4. It would be another misunderstanding of some kind and he didn't know enough of their incomprehensible language to ask them what it was—

#### Suddenly, as it always came

Suddenly, as it always came, he felt someone or something standing close behind him and peering over his shoulder. He dropped his hand to the blaster he had taken to wearing at all times and whirled.

Nothing was behind him. There never was. The control room was empty, with no hiding place for anything, and the door was closed, locked by the remote-control button beside him. There was nothing.

##### The sensation of being watched faded

> The sensation of being watched faded, as though the watcher had withdrawn to a greater distance. It was perhaps the hundredth time within six days that he had felt the sensation. And when he slept at night something came to nuzzle at his mind; faceless, formless, utterly alien. For the past three nights he had not let the blaster get beyond quick reach of his hand, even when in bed.

###### It could not be on the ship

But whatever it was, it could not be on the ship. He had searched the ship twice, a methodical compartment-by-compartment search that had found nothing. It had to be the work of the natives from outside the ship. Except….

Why, if the natives were telepathic, did the one called Throon go through the weary pretense of trying to learn a mutually understandable form of communication?
